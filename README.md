An expert level modpack brought to you by Catt Industries

The main mods are GregTech and Create. You will start with basic flint tools before advancing into the world of Create and rotational force. Once you get your hands on some bronze you start GregTech. As of 24 March 2024 progression quests only take you to the start of the Zpm age, though you can continue to the end of the default GT progression at UHV. There are 230 mods and counting!

More quests and progression through the end of the MAX tier so you can build the stargate are coming soon.
